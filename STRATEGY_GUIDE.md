---

## 📊 Strategic Principles (Priority Order)

### 1. **Set Completion Speed** (Highest Priority)
- **Goal**: Complete 3 sets as fast as possible
- **Tactics**:
  - Focus on 2-card sets (Brown, Dark Blue, Utility) for speed
  - Use wildcards aggressively to complete sets
  - Don't spread properties across too many colors

### 2. **High-Value Set Targeting**
- **Best Sets for Rent**:
  1. **Dark Blue** (2 cards) - 3M/8M rent
  2. **Green** (3 cards) - 2M/4M/7M rent
  3. **Railroad** (4 cards) - 1M/2M/4M/8M rent
- **Avoid**: Brown, Light Blue (low rent values)

### 3. **Defensive Banking**
- **Rule**: Always keep $5M+ in bank
- **Why**: Survive Debt Collector attacks without losing properties
- **When to Bank**:
  - Action cards you can't use immediately
  - Low-value money cards
  - Duplicate properties you don't need

### 4. **Action Card Timing**

#### **Deal Breaker** (Most Powerful)
- **When to Use**:
  - Opponent has 2 complete sets (about to win)
  - Steal a high-value complete set (Dark Blue, Green)
- **When to Save**:
  - Early game (no complete sets exist yet)
  - You have Just Say No to protect yourself

#### **Sly Deal**
- **Best Targets**:
  - Properties that complete YOUR sets
  - High-value properties (Dark Blue, Green)
  - Properties that break opponent's almost-complete sets
- **Avoid**: Random low-value properties

#### **Just Say No**
- **Save For**:
  - Blocking Deal Breakers
  - Blocking high rent charges
  - Protecting your complete sets
- **Don't Waste On**: Small rent charges, Debt Collector

#### **Rent Cards**
- **Optimal Use**:
  - Only play when you have complete sets
  - Target richest opponent
  - Use Double Rent with high-value sets

### 5. **Wildcard Strategy**
- **Placement Priority**:
  1. Complete a set immediately
  2. Add to almost-complete high-value sets
  3. Start a new high-value set
- **Flexibility**: Rearrange wildcards during your turn to optimize

### 6. **Property Payment Tactics**
- **When Forced to Pay**:
  - Pay with money first
  - If no money, pay with lowest-value properties
  - NEVER break a complete set unless bankrupt
- **Strategic Bankruptcy**: Sometimes better to pay nothing than break a complete set

5. ❌ **Hoarding action cards** - Use them or bank them
6. ❌ **Poor wildcard placement** - Always optimize for set completion
7. ❌ **No defensive banking** - Keep cash reserves
